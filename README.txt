# PRESENTATION DU PROJET DES "AMICONES"

## OBJECTIF

This project is our answer to the subject of the 2017 edition of the Hackathon "Design4Green".

The subject is the following : __Develop a search engine within a web application.__

Concretely, we had to create a directory allowing the user to find a dentist and to contact him thanks to the informations provided.

A provided file contains the informations about 1000 dentists with the following attributes :

* Id
* First name
* Last name
* Email
* Gender
* Address
* City
* Phone
* Image
* Openings
* Specialty

The search should be done through more than one criterion.


Les spécifications techniques supplémentaires sont les suivantes :

* Special care should be taken with the user experience.
* Data must be able to be used by other applications (eg the address must be able to be easily
used by a navigation system).
* The order of search results should be random.
* A system must allow the user to identify the dentists he has already contacted.
